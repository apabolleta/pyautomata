## Introduction

> Automata theory is the study of abstract machines and automata, as well as the computational problems that can be solved using them. It is a theory in theoretical computer science with close connections to mathematical logic.

> [...]
>
> An automaton (automata in plural) is an abstract self-propelled computing device which follows a predetermined sequence of operations automatically. An automaton with a finite number of states is called a finite automaton (FA) or finite-state machine (FSM).

## Description

`pyautomata` is a Python package for creating and simulating finite state machines (FSM) and similar computational models. It allows users to define states, transitions, and inputs for various types of automata, enabling easy simulation and analysis of their behavior.

Ideal for both educational and practical use, `pyautomata` simplifies the process of building FSMs and exploring concepts in automata theory, such as state transitions, acceptance conditions, and automaton equivalence.
